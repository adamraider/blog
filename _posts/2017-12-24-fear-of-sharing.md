The Internet is written in ink. 

This is an oftly uneasy truth. Every word that we share on social media will likely persist for decades to come. Allowing for anyone with an interest in us to scrutinize our past thoughts. 

How often do we self-censor ourselves for fear of saying something wrong? 
What if we accidentally offend a future employer or an old friend? 

Before a thought is shared, it belongs to you. You get to choose how to interpret it. With what lens it's meant to be rendered with. The idea morphs just as your perspectives and values do with time. It's safe.

However, when a thought is shared publicly it no longer belongs to you. Sure, it's attributed to you as the author, but it now exists in the reader's domain. To be read in whatever context might fit their bias. You're at the mercy of the reader. Tread carefully.

Why is this important? Unconventional ideas are at the heart of innovation, comedy, and art. They challenge our biases and force us to audit our values. 

Discourse and the free exchange of ideas is absolutely essential to our modern societies. We should not only acknowledge that it's okay for us to have disagreements, we should _celebrate it_. This is the foundation of the scientific method and of Western values.

Now truthfully, I don't care that Jake at Starbucks pronounced your name wrong. That's not the point. Of course every inane idea that our brain may spawn is probably not worthy of sharing to the world. Some degree of self-censorship can be a good thing. It's the intensity to which we self-censor the values that we hold closest to us. At which point, I believe it becomes an existential problem and compromises our happiness.

I've started this blog as a way to get more comfortable sharing my thoughts. It's an interesting practice in confidence and humility. I welcome you to constructively challenge my thoughts, and am reachable with an open mind at [adam@raider.tech](mailto:adam@raider.tech).
