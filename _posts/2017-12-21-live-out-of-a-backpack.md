In late June of 2016, I bought a one-way ticket from New York City to London. I brought a carry-on backpack with me, no checked luggage, and lived in various accommodations in London, Manchester, Prague, and Oslo. I didn’t plan or book anything in advance. I flew home to New York City in early September. These are some tips on how to live out of a 40L backpack for three months.

## The tips
In order from objectively useful to subjectively awesome.

* Never check luggage, it'll save you time, mitigate the risk of losing your stuff, and force you to minimize to the essentials. 
* Get a credit-card with 0% foreign transaction fees, avoid cash as much as possible.
* Scan, encrypt and store your passport, and insurance on a cloud server.
* Before you arrive at a new destination, memorize/save the numbers for emergency services.
* If you can buy it at your destination(s) and aren't *absolutely* sure you’ll need it, don’t bring it. 
* A smart phone is your most useful possession. Call a cab, find your way when lost, translate the menu from Czech to English, find a place to spend the night.
* A VPN will allow you to circumvent geo-restrictions on websites. As well as keep your data safe while using public wifi.
* Noise-isolating headphones. If you haven't joined the club already, do it.
* Keep your money and essential medications in two places at all times. Some on your person (front pocket), some in your bag (locked compartment).
* Carry as little cash/valuables on you as possible. It'll give you peace of mind.
* Enable wifi calling on your phone to save data.
* E-books are your new friends, if you must carry a paper book, give it to someone when you’re finished before you buy another. It’s a nice gesture and will keep your bag light.
* Hotels are boring (and expensive). I stayed in: 4 AirBnBs, 1 apartment, 2 friend-of-a-friend's apartments, 1 hostel, and 1 hotel.
* Don't bring a camera. Your phone is more than adequate, always available and doesn't add weight to your bag.
* Hostels are really fun for short amounts of time.
* Pre-download your favorite tunes from Spotify so you’re not wasting precious data.
* Find joy not in things, but in experiences and the people you share them with.
